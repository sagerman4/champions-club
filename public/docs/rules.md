### Draft rules
- Each player is auctioned off starting at one dollar
- Further bidding may take place at random
- Bids are increased by a minimum of one dollar
- Whole numbers only
- Ownership is awarded to the highest bidder
- Player is locked after five seconds of no contest
- Owners must bid within the confines of their salary and available team positions
- Meaning you can only bid on players you have a position available for and that you can presently afford.

### Player Ownership
- An owner may retain a player at draft salary for two years ("A" Year & "B" Year) before being released back into the player pool automatically at the conclusion of his B Year.
- An owner may choose to award any player a contract at the conclusion of the "A" year instead of the retained salary in the "B" year and loss of player at the end of the "B" season. To award a player a contract the following formula must be used.

```
(number of contract years) x (five dollars) + (player's starting salary)
```

So, if I draft Arian Foster for 2 dollars and he has a good "A" year and I don't want to lose him after his "B" year I can award him a contract in place of his "B" year. Say I want to extend Foster a contract for three years, the formula would work as follows.

```
3x5+2=17
```

**Essentially:**
2 year contract 10+salary
3 year contract 15+salary
4 year contract 20+salary    ...and so on

I now have Foster under contract for three years paying him a total salary of 17 dollars each year for three more years. If I choose to play him through his "B" year at his original 2 dollar salary he'll be returned to player pool at the conclusion of year two ("B").

- After a player's contract is expired they return to the player pool as a free agent for the next season.
- A player may be dropped for no penalty and their salary reimbursed to the owner within the "A" and "B" years.
- A player under contract may be dropped but at a 50% contract penalty for the duration of the contract.
     - Meaning if a player is under contract for three years at 16 dollars and is dropped for any reason, the owner must still pay 8 dollars a year for the length of the contract. Penalties are rounded up to the nearest dollar. The penalty still stands even if the player is picked up or drafted by another team.


### Contract Extensions
- An owner may extend a players contract additional years by following the formula below

(number of additional contract years) x (eight dollars) + (player's current contract salary)

- This amount is paid each year for the duration of the contract.

- A contract may only be extended once.  

### Injuries and Ineligibility
- Any player who is ineligible to play for whatever reason may be dropped with no penalty and his salary reimbursed to the owner.

- However, to avoid imbalance issues with star players being dropped. Each player dropped will be reviewed and subjected to commissioners ruling (non biased circumstance) or a league vote.

**Owners need to be conscious of how much money they spend in the first draft. You'll need money for contracts, free agent acquisitions, and trades down the line. No handouts. Even if you get buried under penalties so plan ahead.**


### Trades
- Trades are simple, if a player is traded from team 1 in his "A" year he finishes on team 2 in that same year for the same salary. However, if a player is traded in his "B" year the owner may choose to convert his "B" year salary to a contract with the normal formula.

- Owners must honor the contracts of players they trade for.
- Anytime a player enters the player pool ("free agency") their previous contract values are void.
- Free agency (waiver) pickups entitle the player to a new salary. (Whatever value he is picked up at)
- No trading salary dollars or draft picks (there are none…)
- Trading for the season locks this year on NOVEMBER 15

- If an owner receives a player from a trade in his “B” year the new owner has the opportunity to convert the “B” year to a contract. The “B” year becomes year 1 of the contract.  

### Penalties
Two penalties exist in this league.

- **Overspend penalty**- where, through drafting, waivers, or trading an owner overspends on his Salary cap.
     - The highest ranked player on the offending team will be returned to the player pool and funds reimbursed to the owner until the salary is under the $250 cap.
- If the owner is still over the $250 cap each player in order of rank (highest to lowest) will be returned to the pool until the team salary is at or under $250.
**The reason for this is that yahoo can't manage our contract procedure effectively. While it can, however, manage trades and waivers it is limited. Situations can arise where an owner can overspend. It is your responsibility to insure this doesn't happen.**

- **Ineligible team penalty**- If an owner does not have enough players to field a full team on game day. Then that owner forfeits the matchup of that week. (Standard)

### Free Agency/Waiver Wire
(FAAB w/ Reverse order of standings tiebreaker)
- Free Agent Acquisition Budgets (FAAB)
- Each Owner receives a dollar amount (what you have left out of your $250) to place blind bids on waived players.
- Owner with the highest bid at the end of the waiver period claims that player and that bid amount is deducted from the owner's acquisition budget.
- Ties are determined by the Owners league standings. Lowest getting priority.
- Waiver Time - 2 Days
